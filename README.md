## Jenkins Admin

A set of jenkins api scripts for administration purposes. Inspired by the following repos:

* https://github.com/Praqma/JenkinsAsCodeReference
* https://github.com/samrocketman/jenkins-bootstrap-jervis
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker

### Post-initialization scripts
Put these groovy scripts at $JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/. These scripts will be run after Jenkins starts up and can be used to configure Jenkins to your needs
